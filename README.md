Description: 
This is a CLI-based game imitating Minecraft's gameflow. We use object oriented programming concept with C++ as the language.

## How to run
* If you only wanted to run "play" the game, run ``` .\main ``` (if you are using Windows) on your command-prompt or ``` ./main.exe ```
(if you are using Linux).

* If you want to recompile, we recommend you to compile in Windows operating system (since the makefile is made for Windows system). To compile, run ``` MinGW32-make compile ```.
